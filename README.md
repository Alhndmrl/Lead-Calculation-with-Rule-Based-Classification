# Lead Calculation with Rule Based Classification

## Business Problem
A game company wants to create new level-based customer definitions (personas) by using some features of its customers, and to create segments according to these new customerdefinitions and to estimate how much the new customers can earn on average according to these segments.

### For example:
It is desired to determine how much a 25-year-old male user from Turkey who is an IOS user can earn on average.


## Dataset Story

The Persona.csv dataset contains the prices of the products sold by an international game company and some demographic information of the users who buy these products. The data set consists of records created in each sales transaction. This means table not singularized. In other words, a user with certain demographic characteristics may have made more than one purchase.

### Variables

| **Variable** | **Definition**                       |  
| :-------- | :-------------------------------- |
| **Price**      | Customer's Payment |
| **Source**      | Customer's Device Type |
| **Sex**      | Customer's Sex |
| **Country**      | Customer's Country |
| **Age**      | Customer's Age |
